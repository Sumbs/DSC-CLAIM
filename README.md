# CLAIM (Prototype)

Recycling has (literally) never been more rewarding! Turn your trash into cash with Claim!

Claim is an application that allows you to earn points that are redeemable with our partner stores by depositing specific wastes, alongside a few bonus activities you could do. With Claim, we'll slowly be turning this world into a cleaner one.
